# Generating Hi-C heatmaps

## Background


## Running Pretext on galaxy

### step 1: mapping Hi-C reads to the **scaffolded** genome

This step is similar to the scaffolding process; we use BWA to map the Hi-C Illumina reads to the genome, but we use the **scaffolded genome generated by YaHS** as the reference genome. 

To run BWA:


### step 2: run Pretext to generate the Hi-C heatmap
