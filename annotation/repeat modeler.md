# Annotation of Repeats
*being updated...*

## Background
For identification and annotation of transposable element (TE) families, we use the RepeatModeler package. RepeatModeler uses three de novo repeat finding programs ( RECON, RepeatScout and LtrHarvest/Ltr_retriever) which employ complementary computational methods for identifying repeat elements from sequence data.

Here is the link to [RepeatModeler paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1921046117?download=true) and here you find the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler). 


## Run RepeatModeler on Galaxy  
From Tools panel choose [**RepeatModeler** Model repetitive DNA](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/csbl/repeatmodeler/repeatmodeler/2.0.3+galaxy0). Make sure that the version is 2.03 (the newest one gives error). 

Choose the fasta file from Shasta and `Run Tool`.
